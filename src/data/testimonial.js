      'I hired Prabin to build our mobile app and he did a great job! He was able to get it built and released to both Apple and Google Play app stores with great quality. Prabin has been the ideal partner; flexible, reliable, and very responsive. He also has great time management skills and always comes to the table with ideas and suggestions to help make the project run smoother. Highly recommended!',

      'I had a bad experience with freelancing previously and was quite afraid when I hired Prabin to work on our telecom app. But he is such a professional that he right away made me feel that he was the right choice for the job. I needed a full stack developer who could work on redesigning existing system and also create new applications as we moved forward, and Prabin has done a brilliant job in that regard. He has excellent knowledge on Ruby on Rails and React. He always comes up with suggestions and is very approachable and flexible. I will definitely hire him again in the future and recommend him to anyone wanting to hire him!',
