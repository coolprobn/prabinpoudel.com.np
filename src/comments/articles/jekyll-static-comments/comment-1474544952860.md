@Arnab - I'm sure Staticman could be "bended" to support threaded comments, but
it would take some work on your end. Off the top of my head I'd probably do
something similar to how Wordpress adds **reply** links to each comment.

That could be used to create a variable that references the comment # being
replied to. Which you'd send with the rest of the comment data to Staticman,
adding it the YAML Front Matter.

Then in the comment Liquid code you'd add some sort of check for that variable
and if present on the current comment, pull in any replies. Probably using
something like
[the `where` filter](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/advanced-liquid-where/).
