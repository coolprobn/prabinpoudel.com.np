You can do something like what I've done wrapping the comment form with a Liquid
conditional:

```html
{% unless page.comments_locked == true %}
<!-- comment form here -->
{% else %}
<p><em>Comments are closed.</em></p>
{% endunless %}
```

Then I add `comments_locked: true` to a post's YAML Front Matter that I want to
disable adding new comments to. You can see an example of
[how that looks here](https://mademistakes.com/articles/ipad-pro/#comments).
