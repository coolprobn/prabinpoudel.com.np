@Bozdar - I think it's doable, just might introduce some complexity to your
build/deploy process.

For example, I don't use GitHub to build or host my site, but simply store my
source files there in a repo. My build/deploy process with Staticman goes like
this:

1. Comment is submitted to Staticman, which creates a pull request against my
   site repo on GitHub.
2. Comment pull request is merged and then I pull that commit to my local repo.
3. Build the site locally.
4. Deploy the contents of my `_site` folder to my server. I use a
   [Gulp rsync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rsync) task but there are
   several [other options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/)
   available to you.

All Staticman needs is to be made a collaborator on your repo and be able to see
your `_config.yml` so it can be configured."
