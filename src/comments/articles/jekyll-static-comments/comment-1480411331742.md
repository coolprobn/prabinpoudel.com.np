Thanks for the awesome theme _Minimal Mistakes_.

Unfortunately, I couldn't configure static comments for my project.

I receive pull requests on github, but comments not published in my post.
https://github.com/danykeep/danykeep.github.io

Help me please, how can i solve this problem? I tried to turn to false
moderation option, but it didn't help.
