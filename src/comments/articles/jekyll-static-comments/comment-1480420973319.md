@Dany - Change Staticman's path in `_config.yml`. You were probably using the
demo site's path which places the comment data files in a different location.
You want it set as:

```yaml
staticman:
  path: '/_data/comments/{options.slug}'
```

Move your existing `/comments/` folder under `/_data/` after you make the config
change and on rebuild they should up.
