I had similar problem with @Dany, and it has been resolved by changing `path`
and `/comment/` folder.

But, now I get another problem that comment cannot be submitted. Error message:

```
Sorry, there was an error with your submission. Please make sure all required fields have been completed and try again
```

Thank you. Repo: https://github.com/nurandi/nurandi.github.io
