I tried enabling Akismet with the following but it never quite worked:

```yaml
akismet:
  enabled: true
    author: "name"
    authorEmail: "email"
    authorUrl: "url"
    content: "message"
    type: "comment"
```

Were you able to get it working?

From this
[line in Staticman's documenation](https://staticman.net/docs/configuration#akismet.enabled)
I got the feeling the public instance of Staticman needed it setup. Wasn't sure
if that was the case or if it was only for those running their own instances of
the app.
