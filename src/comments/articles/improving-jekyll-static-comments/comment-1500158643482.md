Great!

Not sure what could be going on with the comment order. I've heard of others
having the same issue so you're not alone. If you're using the same instance of
Jekyll to build and serve then the output should be exactly the same. If you're
using some sort of CI service to build/deploy your site then it's possible the
environments and Jekyll versions are out of sync and that's the issue.

I am using unique id's to attach child comments to their parent by using the
`replying_to` field. There's a chance my code above is old and outdated. If you
haven't already, reference my GitHub repo instead since that is the actual code
I use to build comments on my site.
