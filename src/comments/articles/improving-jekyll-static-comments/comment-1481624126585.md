To speed up the build time I used a Docker image in Travis. With this I don't
have to wait for the installation of all Jekyll dependencies.

The size is WIP but you can get some ideas from my
[Travis config, and Dockerfile](https://github.com/zburgermeiszter/blog.burgermeiszter.com/blob/master/.travis.yml).
