Ultimately it boiled down to the fact that since `where_exp` was not working for
me. With my approach I was receiving each comment as below. Hence the need to
use `[1]`.

```
["comment-1493177616768", {"_id"=>"217db4e0-2a31-11e7-9594-27fd6f0988e3", "_parent"=>"http://mattseemon.dev/blog/karaoke/2017/04/25/Latest-tracks.html", "name"=>"Matt Seemon", "email"=>"09d1cc2c678124c06dd0ab1a0351f665", "url"=>"https://mattseemon.in", "message"=>"Testing Staticman Comments", "replying_to"=>"", "hidden"=>"", "date"=>"2017-04-26T03:33:36.759Z"}]
```

It seems to be working with replies as well without anything breaking, so far.
Fingers crossed. I will know once i go live. Thank you for all your help.
