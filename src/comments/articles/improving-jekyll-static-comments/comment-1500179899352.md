I really appreciate your help.

You are right that I'm using a CI service, but after some more testing, I found
that the ordering of replies is completely unpredictable and it is changing both
on my local and on the production. I'm on the latest version of Jekyll (3.5).
Maybe that's causing the difference. BTW, I have been using the latest code from
your GH repo.

So I made a minor modification to your code to use the parent's `_id` field as
the replying-to value of the child, instead of relying on the position of the
comments (because that seems to be unpredictable at least in my environment).
Now it seems to be working consistently.

I'm yet to get into reply notifications and MailGun setup. If I run into any
issues, I may seek your help again.

I must say that your 2 blog posts on Staticman have been extremely helpful.
Without your posts I may not have even made a serious attempt at it.

I don't have enough words to thank you!"
