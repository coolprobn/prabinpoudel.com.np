No posts about how I'm doing it, but it's pretty easy to do if you're using
Staticman to power your site's comments.

Because all my comments are stored in `.yml` files in the `_data` folder you can
use the Liquid
[`size` array filter](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/filters/array-filters#size)
to determine how many comments are in a particular post.

If you examine the
[source of my site](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/) you'll
see this line which does just this:

```liquid
{{ site.data.comments[page.slug] | size }} Comment{% if site.data.comments[page.slug].size > 1 %}s{% endif %}
```

On
[post listings](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_includes/entry.html#L39-L41)
that loop over `site.posts` I modify it slightly to pull in `post.slug` instead
of `page.slug` so it can grab the correct set of comments to count.
