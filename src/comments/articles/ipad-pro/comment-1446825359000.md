Great Article. I too like Procreate but sometimes feel there are too many
options which can be overwhelming. Also wished they would put the color palettes
and tools always visible like in Paper.

As for the iPad Pro will be getting it at launch and will probable get a
charging Apple Pencil dock from Moxiware.
