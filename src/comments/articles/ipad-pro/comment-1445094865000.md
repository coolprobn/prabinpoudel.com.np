All good points. I'm certain I'd love the Pro. What I'm wrestling with is will I
have buyer's remorse if I drop a grand on something I don't really _need_ when
I'm pretty sure they will release the cheaper iPad Air 3 in the springtime.

That and I'm still having a hard time convincing my wife it's a worthy purchase.
Haha.
