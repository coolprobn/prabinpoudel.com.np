1. I broke it out into a submodule so I wasn't bloating the size of the main repo with a GB of images. For my Jekyll build, feature images are in their own folder so I could target them with a gulp task to generate multiple thumbnails as part of my responsive images strategy. I didn't do that with the other content images as it was too much to manage. For my Gatsby build it's much simpler... all images in a single folder... all resized, all responsive, all optimized by Gatsby and friends.

2. For my Jekyll build the gulp image tasks run before Jekyll. I do some shuffling around of the optimized images so Jekyll doesn't *see* them and isn't moving large folders around as that slows the build down.

3. Yes. I lazyload all images. For Jekyll I created a small plugin that [rewrites the markup of Markdown written images](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/blob/master/src/_plugins/markdown_img_replacement.rb) using the `data-src` attribute as needed by [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes). For Gatsby I leverage the [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) and [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/) plugins to automatically lazyload images.

4. For Jekyll I build locally using my gulp tasks. When happy with the results I push up to GitHub which triggers a build on Netlify, which then uses my production gulp tasks to build and deploy. For Gatsby it's similar. But instead of having Netlify build my site I do that with Travis CI since I ran into timeout errors on Netlify's free tier. When Travis finishes building the site, it uses[`netlify-cli`](https://github.com/netlify/cli) to deploy the files.
