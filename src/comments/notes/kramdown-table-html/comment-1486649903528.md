message: "Have you looked at the
[`markdownify` filter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/)? I use it to do
something similar to place Markdown text inside of a `figcaption` element.

There's several ways to handle this without the need of a plugin. You could do
something like this with a Liquid `capture`:

```liquid
{% capture your_md %}Here is some Markdown you'd like to **capture**.{% endcapture %}
```

Then inject the captured variable into whatever you want and add the Markdownify
filter so Kramdown processes it like so:

```html
<details>
  {{ your_md | markdownify }}
</details>
```

Which would give you the following HTML output:

```html
<details>
  <p>Here is some Markdown you'd like to <strong>capture</strong>.</p>
</details>
```

If you don't want to bother with all the captures you could build your own
[Jekyll include](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/#passing-parameters-to-includes)
that you could pass text through as a `parameter` to be Markdownified.
