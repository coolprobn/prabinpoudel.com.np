End of June FiftyThree sent out an email saying they were shutting down the
Public Stream/Mix on August 15th due to low usage.

> **Shutting down the Public Stream / Mix**
>
> The Public Stream feature of Paper will shut down on August 15th. Three years
> ago, we launched the Public Stream (previously known as Mix) as a place for
> users to share and remix Paper creations. It was born out of idealism and
> curiosity, a wish to open up creativity and share Paper creations around the
> globe. While sharing sparked tremendous creativity, a relatively small number
> of Paper creators continue to use the Public Stream today. Many creators find
> a larger, more engaged audience by sharing publicly on
> [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/madewithpaper/),
> [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23madewithpaper&src=typd),
> [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/madewithpaper) and elsewhere. Since the
> social web has proven to be better place to share your work with the world, we
> have decided to shut down the Public Stream and focus on the core Paper
> experience.
>
> Be sure to save ideas posted only to the Public Stream before August 15th if
> you want to keep them. Ideas in Paper grids other than the Public Stream will
> remain on your device.
>
> Starting today, we encourage you to share your Paper creations on your
> preferred social network using the #MadeWithPaper hashtag. We will be
> launching a website soon that showcases Paper creations from popular social
> networks.
>
> Shutting down the Public Stream will allow us to iterate faster on Paper and
> introduce many exciting new features. A major update is planned for Paper
> later this year that includes the return of Paper journals and other features.
> Stay tuned for details in the coming months.
>
> We want to thank everyone who shared their creativity on Mix. In many ways,
> seeing your ideas has made us even stronger believers in our cause, to make
> creativity more accessible.
>
> We hope to see you online.
