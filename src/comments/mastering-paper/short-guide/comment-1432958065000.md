Have you updated Paper recently? They added a new set of tools called
[**Think Kit**](https://wetransfer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001333846-Canvas-Drawing-Tools).
These tools let you draw perfectly straight lines, circles, squares, and arrows.
So what was done here is they drew one blue circle and then used the new cut
tool to reposition and copy/duplicate the circle several times. Then drew over
that with the pen tool freehand.
