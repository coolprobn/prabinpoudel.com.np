1. Yes. It's kind of like crosshatching. I use that to build up the _beefier_
   parts of a light and thin cloud. For the really thin streaky ones it's
   basically just some horizontal pencil strokes. I use shading more in the
   fluffier clouds to add roundness to some parts.
2. And you're right on the sun being lit and everything else in silo. I went
   with a more dramatic eclipse that you'd almost never see. Just my _artistic_
   interpretation.
