This is great--thank you very much for providing these tutorials! Really useful.

Two questions about this one:

1. I don't quite understand what you're doing to create the cloud wisps. Is that
   the pencil tool? And is it more like shading, or crosshatching, or just a few
   individual lines? In your closeup (with the arrows drawn on it), it looks
   like a few short angled individual lines, but in the finished piece it looks
   more like a few longer almost-flat individual lines, and somewhere in one of
   the sample image writeups (which are also really useful!) I think you said
   something about shading.

2. I'm not understanding why/when the sun would appear as a silhouetted black
   half-circle--isn't the light of the sun what's causing other things to appear
   as silhouettes?

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series!"
