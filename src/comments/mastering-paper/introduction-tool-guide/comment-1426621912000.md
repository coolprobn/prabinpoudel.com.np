Probably not the answer you want to hear but if you want to spend the money on
an expensive Bluetooth stylus give the Pogo Connect a try. It is the only stylus
I know of that has a dedicated **undo** button supported by Paper.

I do know where you're coming from. I absolutely hated the Rewind gesture when I
first used Paper. Once I got over trying to second guess it and follow through
with the gesture it started working better for me. A few years later and I have
almost no problem using it now.

The speed at which you make the circular gesture and the amount of fingers you
use makes a big difference. Sometimes you'll notice it drawing on screen instead
of undoing, but if you continue with the motion it fixes itself. The Blend
feature works that way too.

There appears to be some sort of **auto-correct** going on in the software that
tries to fix mistakes, but it only figures that out after the fact. Learning to
trust that it will do the right thing can help."
