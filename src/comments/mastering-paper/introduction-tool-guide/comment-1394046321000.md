Use two fingers, and move it in a circular motion. Not too fast and not too
slow. Just stick with it and you'll eventually learn how to trigger it 100% of
the time.

And if you're really having problems using it, you can always buy a Pogo Connect
if you have a 3rd/4th generation iPad. There's a button on the stylus that acts
as an undo in Paper.
