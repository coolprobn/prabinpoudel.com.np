Being an artist, I've just about used every sketching, drawing, painting, apps
available out there in art heaven! There is nothing that comes close to Paper53!
I think it is the _simplicity_ of the app, and the ability to create high
quality sketches and paintings! I'm using it for my art journal this year. I am
using an adonit stylus...it works great! Love, love, love this app!
