Mr.Rose, I would really like to thank you for all the support and advises you've
been giving to me, it was really appreciated.

You can say now i have a lot of stylus now, and the surprising funny thing that
after weeks finally i got my Pogo connect and i am in love with it... ‚ù§

I didn't believe how smooth and amazing drawing with Pogo ...

Keep watching your great draws & journals.

Thank you again Mr.Rose .. Thanks to you also "TenOne Design"

Luliio.
