There's not much more to the process than what I included above.

1. Use the pen tools to create the general shape and fill it in.
2. Add some dots of various sizes around it to simulate the splatter.
3. To make some blobs look more 3D add highlights using white or another light
   color with the pencil tool.
4. To finish it off add a drop shadow with a light gray and the watercolor
   brush, zoom in, and paint quickly along the edge where you want to cast a
   shadow.
