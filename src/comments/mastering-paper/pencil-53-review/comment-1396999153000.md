Thanks for sharing your experience with a mesh tipped stylus, it's been helpful.

I haven't experienced any major crashes with Paper (or Pencil) yet that has
caused me to lose work. Although I know others have so you're not alone. The
worst that's happen to me have been miss triggers with Pencil erasing a line
after I drew it. Those kinks have gotten much better with software updates.

One safeguard you could try if duplicating pages becomes a burden is to flip
between journals and open other pages. I've noticed that doing so forces all the
strokes you've made to be committed to the page and helps avoid them potentially
getting lost.

Only drawback to this technique is you can't rewind on the page if you go back
to it after opening another. I think Paper only keeps one page in memory at a
time and flipping to a new one clears the undo (rewind) history. Same thing
happens if you force quit the app.
