The [Wacom Bamboos](https://amzn.to/2ZNSXSZ) are a pretty good all around
affordable styli. I'd suggest getting a stylus that is fairly cheap to see how
you like drawing with one.

Since you're using an iPad 2 all _dumb_ styli pretty much work the same. It
really comes down to your preferences on fit, finish, durability, and how it
feels in hand.
