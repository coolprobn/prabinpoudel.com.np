It's a nice enough stylus alright, but for \$60 you might as well buy a Pogo
Connect and use it with many other apps. Who wants a stylus that works with only
a single app, with severe limitations, that prides itself on not having a proper
backup option?

Nice try, FiftyThree... but get with the picture!
