I got my Pogo Connect a few years ago from Amazon. It's currently
[going for \$55](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K448L4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009K448L4&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=2FUVY5QHKFTKTJIN)
which is about \$20-30 cheaper than what I paid.
