Ok so I tried a few things and:

1. i need to run jquery 1.71. Looks like the rest of your theme is unaffected by
   this so far.
2. I had to move the scripts within the head so I changed `_layouts/page.html`
   and `post.html` to have `{% include scripts.html %}` just after the include.

Now Galleryview works! But the top menubar doesn't...
