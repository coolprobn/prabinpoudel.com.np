Doesn't look like it's loading the Disqus script, which is really odd because if
it worked locally and nothing changed I don't know why it wouldn't on the live
server.

You could try removing the Liquid if statements in `scripts.html` include and
force it to load the script.

Change
`{% if site.disqus_shortname and page.comments %}{% include disqus_comments.html %}{% endif %}`
to `{% include disqus_comments.html %}` and see if the script loads.
