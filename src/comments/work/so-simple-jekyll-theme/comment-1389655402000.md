So close. My guess is using jQuery 1.7.1 broke something with the responsive nav
script and it's not triggering a few CSS classes that hide and show it based on
screen size. If you don't care about that you could strip it out and remove some
CSS styling. If you inspect `nav` element and the lists inside it you should be
able to spot the CSS that needs modifying.

There's probably a few `display: none`s in there that is hiding the nav that
could be taken out.

Or check the [Responsive Nav's site](http://responsive-nav.com/) for a possible
fix.
