Amazing theme. I am constantly in awe that this is how my blog looks.

One question: a problem I haven't been able to solve...

I've tried modifying the **pygments.less** `.font(15);` section to make the code
snippet text bigger and I've tried to make the entire blog's body font bigger in
**variables.less** `@doc-font-size: 18;`

I'm on Windows and node and grunt are installed properly. I ran `npm install` in
the theme folder and then I tried modifying the fonts in those less files a
couple times and then running grunt. I the `min.css` is recreated and I think it
all runs properly except for the image minifier.

```bash
Running "recess:dist" (recess) task
File "assets/css/main.min.css" created.
Original: 68310 bytes.
Minified:
53648 bytes.
Running "uglify:dist" (uglify) task
File "assets/js/scripts.min.js"
created.
Running "imagemin:dist" (imagemin) task
Fatal error: spawn ENOENT
```

But the fonts never change their size when I look at the blog after doing this
and I also inspected the text to confirm that the fonts didn't change. Am I
missing something?"
