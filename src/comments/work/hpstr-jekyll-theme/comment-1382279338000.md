Did you set `url:` properly in \_config.yml?

If it's not set to your domain when pushing live or left blank (or
`http://localhost:4000`) then the CSS/JS won't load because they rely on
absolute paths in my theme.

If it is set properly and still not working, link me to your repo and I'll take
a look.
