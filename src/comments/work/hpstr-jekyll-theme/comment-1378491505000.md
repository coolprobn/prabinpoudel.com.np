At one point I was using [The Semantic Grid System](http://semantic.gs/), but
gave up on it. Instead I took the easy way out and give all the content a 100%
width for < 768px breakpoints, and everything else gets a max-width of around
900px.

[Preboot's grid system](http://getpreboot.com/) also appealed to me because I
use LESS for my stylesheets.

[Singularity](http://singularity.gs/) looks nice too, but I'm not a Sass man so
I haven't given it a go yet.
