You can also leverage the
["grid" archive type](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#grid-view)
if you don't want to edit any templates.

Simply change `{% include archive-single.html %}` to
`{% include archive-single.html type="grid" %}` in your index pages (eg. the
[home page](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/index.html#L11))
and you'll get a 4 column grid of posts.
