It is possible if your CSS skills are strong. It's tricky to do multi-leveled
navigation with Jekyll but it can be done. I couldn't think of a one-size fits
all solution to cover every use-case so I purposely kept things simple. You can
certainly hack something together that would meet your specific needs.

You'll likely have to hard code some of the navigation lists rather than relying
on data files for all of the menus. Unless you want to string together some
crazy Liquid spaghetti code to do it.

I'd Google around for some ideas. I know I've seen a blog post or two with ways
of dealing with tiered and dynamic navigations in Jekyll.
