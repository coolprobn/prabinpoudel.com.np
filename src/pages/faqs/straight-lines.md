To draw straight lines on the iPad I [use whatever straight edge](/mastering-paper/grid-method/) I have laying around: ruler, book, piece of cardboard, notepad, etc. I have a few Paper by FiftyThree journal pages of "frames" that I duplicate[^duplicate-page] anytime I need them. Saves me the step of having to redraw the same thing over and over again.

[[notice | Think Kit update]]
| With the addition of the [Think Kit tools](https://www.fiftythree.com/think) in Paper drawing straight lines and shapes is even easier (no rulers needed). Simply select the Diagram pen and watch as your scribbles autocorrect them self.

[^duplicate-page]: To copy a page pinch the screen to zoom out and then press and hold on the circle plus button until a duplicate button appears. The tap that.
