Long story short, if you have an iPad Pro do yourself a favor and get an [**Apple Pencil**][apple-pencil]. If you have an older (or non-Pro) model below are all the "dumb" styli I've had experience with.

| Stylus | Quick Impressions |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| [**Apple Pencil**][apple-pencil] | Best stylus I've used hands down. Paired with an iPad Pro it's the closest thing to drawing *for real*. |
| [**Pencil by FiftyThree**][pencil-stylus] | Super reliable, well designed, and long battery life. Tips tend to tare quickly, but they're replaceable. |
| [**Ten One Design Pogo Connect**][pogo-stylus] | Connectivity issues and hardware flaws are maddening to deal with. Ignoring these problems, apps with pressure sensitivity support perform well. |
| [**LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen**][lunatik-stylus] | My trusted sidekick for a long time. Tip (not replaceable) took some serious abuse and kept on licking. Has a refillable roller ball pen if you need a traditional writing instrument. |
| [**Just-Mobile AluPen**][alupen-stylus] | Wears out after a few months of use. Nice solid construction. Tips aren't replaceable. |
| [**ZEN 3 in 1**][zen-stylus] | Precision disc tip dead on arrival so I couldn't test that. Rubber nib seems well made and slightly smaller than others giving a bit more precision to your draws. |
| [**Chalkee Series Kids Stylus**][chalkee] | Good for kids with small hands. Tip isn't replaceable and wears out fast. |
| [**Universal Touch Screen Pen**][cheap-stylus] | Cheap, small, light, and pretty crappy. Comes in a 3 pack that are good as backup styli. |

The first iPad stylus I purchased was a [Just-Mobile AluPen][alupen-stylus] and used it for some time before the rubber tip wore out. Following it I ended up with a [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen][lunatik-stylus] after winning one in an [art competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20120822201917/http://lunatiklife.com/features/post/lunatikonpaper-winners).

I like the Touch Pen because of its solid construction. The tip isn't a squishy rubber nib and is super durable. I've drawn close to 400 portraits with it and it works as flawless as the day I got it. I'd still be using it if I hadn't been lured over to the dark-side of Bluetooth styli.

Speaking of Bluetooth styli, before Apple Pencil, [FiftyThree's Pencil][pencil-stylus] was my go to when using [**Paper**](https://fiftythree.com/paper). Before that, I was all about the [Pogo Connect Smart Pen][pogo-stylus] --- even if it's a piece of crap.
