Read on friend to learn about the hardware and software I use for play and to build Made Mistakes. None of it is terribly exciting or unexpected, but hey --- maybe the curious of you will find it interesting.

## Hardware

- **iMac 21.5-inch**, Late 2013 model with 16GB memory, and stock Apple Magic Mouse and keyboard.
- **Lenovo ThinkStation E30**, 3.30 GHz Intel Xeon with 16 GB memory.
- **iPad 12.9&#x2033; Pro** with the Space Gray finish and Apple Pencil (first generation).
- **iPhone 7 Plus** with Jet Black finish.
- **Apple Watch Series 5** with Space Gray aluminum case.
- [**Canon Rebel XTi DSLR Camera**](https://amzn.to/2R4A1YC) with EF-S 18-55mm and 50mm lenses.

## Design and development

- Operating systems: **macOS Mojave** and **Windows 7**
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following notable extensions:
  1. [**Material Theme Kit**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Theme-MaterialKit)
  2. [**GitLens**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
  3. [**Write Good Linter**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=travisthetechie.write-good-linter)
  4. [**Insert Date String**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring)
  5. [**Lorem ipsum**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.lorem-ipsum)
  6. [**Markdown Preview GitHub Styling**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)
  7. [**Markdown TOC**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlanWalk.markdown-toc)
  8. [**Settings Sync**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)
- [**Sourcetree**](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for Git heavy lifting when VS Code doesn't cut it.
- **Adobe Creative Suite** - Photoshop, Illustrator, and occasionally AfterEffects.
- [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Ruby based static site generator.
- [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - React based framework for building websites and apps.

I've been on a [static site generator](/articles/going-static/) kick the last couple of years and use <s>[**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/)</s> [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to build this page and everything else found on the site. The basic idea is I write a bunch of text in Markdown and it spits out a set of files that are deployed to a webserver.

If you're interested in the specifics of how the site is built I've made its [source available on GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-gatsby) for anyone to fork and download. And because I'm such a cool dude I've also open sourced a couple of [Jekyll themes](/work/jekyll-themes/) for you to use and abuse --- you're welcome!

## Other software

- [**BitWarden**](https://bitwarden.com/) - password manager.
- [**Backblaze**](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/014jkj) - cloud backups.
