Portrait of Rakso S. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/a4RQUD). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

If you squint your eyes just right it almost looks like a photograph. Don't zoom in on the forehead or else you'll notice how unpolished the painting is. But I'm not complaining, 3 hours of work with results like this --- I'll take it!
