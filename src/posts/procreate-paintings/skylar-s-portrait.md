Portrait of Skylár S. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/hvnEKC). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

Please excuse the rough hatching as I was trying to avoid over polishing the face. Maybe some day I'll pick this up again and actually finish it.

Time lapse video recorded within Procreate, completed in approximately 2.5 hours.
