Portrait of T. Steinheil inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/hvnEKC). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2. 

My confidence level with color hasn't been high as of late, so I decided to retreat to working in *black and white*. Haven't settled on a set of brushes I like 100% with Procreate yet, so things still have that oil painting look. To counter some of that "over blended-ness" I applied some grain with the noise brush after getting the facial structure locked.

Now to find paper textures I can import into Procreate to build drawings on top of...

Time lapse video recorded within Procreate, completed in 4 hours and 50 minutes.
