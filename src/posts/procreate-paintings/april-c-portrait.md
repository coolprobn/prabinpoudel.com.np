Portrait of April C. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/idj87H). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

It's been a hectic start to spring so I haven't had too much free time to paint. The announcement of the smaller iPad Pro almost had me pulling the trigger, but I really want the larger version --- but with the True Tone display. I suppose I can wait until this fall...
