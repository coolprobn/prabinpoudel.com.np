Portrait of Jenny x. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/rK7LX). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

In an attempt to fool my brain into seeing shapes and paint more accurately I flipped the canvas upside-down. Not sure if it was the lighting in the reference photo that tripped me up, but I really struggled with the nose and lips.

It's kind of hard to look at now because all I see are the spots I botched. Suppose that's the benefit of working digitally, it's fairly easy to go back in and make alterations --- if I only had the time...

Time lapse video recorded within Procreate, completed in approximately 6 hours.
