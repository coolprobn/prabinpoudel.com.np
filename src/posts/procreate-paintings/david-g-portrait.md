Portrait of David G. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/CIyk0D). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

I could have spent another 5 hours meticulously rendering beard whiskers and cleaning up some sloppy color transitions. But at some point you have to put your kid to bed to rest and grow.

Time lapse video recorded within Procreate, completed in approximately 5 hours.
