Designing a book with Blurb was painless and having it printed was equally enjoyable. I'm really happy with how my first photography book turned out.

## Options to satisfy

I sprung for the more expensive satin paper to give the pages a nice texture and thickness to them. Next time I'm definitely paying extra for a hardcover with slip so pages are better protected. The only negative I've found with the printing is that some of my photographs printed a tad on the dark side. I didn't bother calibrating my monitor or using any of Blurb's supplied [ICC color profiles](http://www.blurb.com/downloads/Blurb_ICC_Profile.icc), so that was probably the issue.

They offer some guidance on [color management](http://www.blurb.com/color-management), that I'll look at more closely next time. I'm also planning on designing my next book using Adobe InDesign and [Blurb's Plug-in](http://www.blurb.com/indesign-plugin) instead of their [BookSmart<sup>Â®</sup>](http://www.blurb.com/booksmart) application --- just so I have total control over each page.
