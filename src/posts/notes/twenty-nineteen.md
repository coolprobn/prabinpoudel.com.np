First time doing a *year in review* post thingy. The statistics below are just for fun as there's nothing to compare them against yet. Should be interesting to see how they deviate next year as I would have never guessed some would be as high as they were.

## 2019 by the numbers

- **1** blog post
- **4** side projects
- **365** days spent growing a beard
- **33** video games played
- **64** movies watched
- **56** days closing all rings on Apple Watch
- **6,522** steps/day average

### Web development

Starting way back in 2017 I experimented with migrating my [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) built personal site over to [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)... things didn't work out so well. It took until 2019 for Gatsby and its ecosystem to mature enough for me to take it seriously.

Up until then it couldn't handle building my site of ~1,000 posts, paginated category/tag archives, and 13,000 images. Plagued with `FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` messages I waited as Gatsby received performance optimizations that fixed my build woes.

With the right cocktail of plugins I finally launched a Gatsby powered site on the last day of 2019, December 31st. Expect a post mortem in a future article as there was a lot I struggled with:

- Adapting Liquid templates to vanilla JavaScript and React.
- Finding Markdown parity with Kramdown features.
- Deploying my own instance of Staticman and getting comments working with Gatsby.
- Replacing custom Jekyll plugin tags.
- Working through Lighthouse scores that were often worse than the pre-Gatsby site.
- Build timeouts on Netlify.

### Open source contributions

![2019 GitHub contributions](../../images/git-commits-2019.png)

In 2019 I pushed **1,056** commits to GitHub, most of which were to my three most popular Jekyll themes: [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme), and [Basically Basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic).

It boggles my mind that a repository that started out as a stripped down theme of my personal site has been: downloaded 96,901 times, forked 10,100 times, and starred 5,993 times. Thanks to everyone who has supported its continued development with kind words and donations!

### A yeard and a half

I've had a love/hate relationship with beard growing for as long as I can remember. For whatever stupid reason I decided I wanted to grow a yeard in 2018... during the middle of the summer.

At the close of 2019 I've gone eighteen months without shaving and plan on trying for whatever you call a 2x yeard. We'll see though as eating soup, snagging hairs in zippers, and daily beard maintenance does get old on occassion.

### Video games played

If it wasn't for the Nintendo Switch and being a portable console, I would have never played this many games. Being able to quickly resume a game before dinner or when the twins are in bed makes a difference.

I'm slowly making it through my backlog of Playstation must plays, but sneaking those in has been  difficult. As most have mature ratings, they're not something I can play with my kids. And the fact that it's not a portable console means I need to wrestle the television from my wife, who sure as shit doesn't want to watch me game for an hour.

| **The Last Guardian** | ★★ | Really wanted to like this one, but the floaty ass controls ruins it for me. Made it about midway through the story... I think. |
| **Shadow of the Tomb Raider** (PS4) | ★★★★ | Enjoyed the tropical scenery more than the snow in Rise. |
| **The Order: 1886** (PS4) | ★★★★ | Purchased on sale, not bad. |
| **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate** (Switch) | ★★★ | Awful at fighting games. Unlocked all the characters, stopped playing shortly after. |

### Movies watched

According to [**Letterboxd**](https://letterboxd.com/mmistakes/) below are all the flicks I watched last year. And here I thought I binged more television series than movies --- guess not.

| Movie | Rating | Note |
| ----- | ------ | ---- |
| **Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker** (2019) | ★★★ | Should have been split into two parts. |
| **Mission: Impossible - Fallout** (2018) | ★★★ | By the Numbers. |
| **Marriage Story**  (2019) | ★★★ | Meh. |

| **Between Two Ferns: The Movie** (2019) | ★★★★ | Yup, what I expected. |
| **In the Shadow of the Moon** (2019) | ★★★ | Sort of like **Looper** I guess. |

| **Solo: A Star Wars Story** (2018) | ★★★★ | Can't believe all the negative press. |
| **Black Mirror: Bandersnatch** (2018) | ★★★ | Would have been fine with this not being *interactive* at all. |

### Health and activity

The last couple of years I've been wanting to ditch FitBit devices for Apple Watch. My hestitation being battery life and needing to charge it daily. As someone who wore a Fitbit for 5 days straight without charging --- this was a deal breaker.

When Apple released a Watch this fall with an always-on screen, I decided to try it out. On paper it does pretty much everything the Fitbits I've owned for years do. But some reason it's motivated me to be active in ways they couldn't.

</figure>

I've gone from hitting move and workout goals 3 days a week to all 7. Earning gift card rewards via [Aetna's **Attain** app](https://www.attainbyaetna.com/) is a great motivator as well.

I still don't like that I need to charge it everyday since I use it for sleep tracking. But a well timed charge during my morning shower is usually enough to top it off for the day.

## Heading into 2020

I don't consciously set goals or make resolutions really. If I can do more of the same as 2019 I'll be happy. Now that I'm more active, I'd like to amp up my consumption of fruits and vegetables this year. I eat a lot of beige processed food that I'm sure is up to no good in my body.

We'll see I guess...
