A few weekends ago I decided to cover one of the walls in the office with a large poster. I've toyed around with black and white rasterbated images before, but I really wanted to see how well a full color one would look. My office walls are a lime green color and I figured something with dark greens would contrast nicely. Choosing a forest scene with a huge owl seemed right up my alley so I got to work on it's creation.

## The process of Rasterbating

Took some quick measurements of the wall's dimensions and uploaded the image to the [Rasterbator](http://posterizer.online/rasterbator/). Got things cropped how I liked and outputted the 120 page PDF file. The next 3 hours I spent trimming the white borders off of each page since my printer doesn't print to the edge. I think next time I do one of these I'm going to leave the borders... cutting these pages consistently was pretty hard. I tried using a trimmer with a rotary blade but the pages slide some regardless of the clamp thing. Oh well.

## Time lapse video

Anyways. After cutting out all the pages I setup my JVC mini-DV camcorder and recorded myself taping each page to the wall. Figured this would be a fun excuse to use the camcorder since I rarely break the thing out after buying it 4 years ago. Took the 2 hours of footage and imported it into iMovie and made a quick time lapse video by speeding it up 4x. I think it came out good and laugh every time I see my stupid cats walking around watching me in confusion.
