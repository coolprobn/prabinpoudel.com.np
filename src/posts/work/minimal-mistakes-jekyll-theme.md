Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or your own server. 

Includes responsive layouts (single, archive index, search, splash, and paginated home page) that look great on mobile and desktop browsers. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you.
