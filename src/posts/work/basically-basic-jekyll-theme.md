Basically Basic is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) meant as a substitute for the default --- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Conventions and features found there are fully supported by **Basically Basic**, with a few enhancements thrown in for good measure:

- Clean responsive design with six customizable skins
- Curriculum Vitæ/Resume layout powered by [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/)
- About page layout
- Disqus Comments and Google Analytics support
- SEO best practices via [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/)
