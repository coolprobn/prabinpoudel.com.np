New to Paper by FiftyThree and can't seem to figure out how to switch tools? I have the short answer for you right here.

They may be subtle, but the white dots beneath the row of tools are a big clue to help solve this mystery. Similar to the dots you find at the bottom of your iOS device's home screen, they indicate there are off-screen goodies to be had.

## Tool switching (iPad)

Swipe across the row of **Think Kit** tools to reveal another set of five ([Fountain Pen][fountain-pen], [Pencil][pencil], [Marker][marker], [Fine Tip Ink Pen][ink-pen], and [Watercolor Brush][watercolor-brush]) to the right.

## Tool switching (iPhone)

And for you iPhone Paper users there are three sets of tools you can swipe through.

I know what you're thinking, "wow how could anyone miss this?" Well from the amount of emails I receive a month asking how to change tools... quite a lot.
