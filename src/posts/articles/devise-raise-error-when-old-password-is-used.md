```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ============ Custom Validation ============
  validate :new_and_old_password_must_be_different

  private
  
  def new_and_old_password_must_be_different
    return if changed.exclude?('encrypted_password')

    password_is_same = Devise::Encryptor.compare(User, encrypted_password_was, password)

    errors.add(:password, I18n.t('validations.not_allowed.old_password')) if password_is_same
  end
end
```

## Conclusion

Factory Bot helps in reusing the same code in multiple test examples, this way you will have to write less code and as they say "Less code is always better".

Thank you for reading. Happy coding!
