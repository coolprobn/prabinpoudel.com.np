This is a live blog, meaning I will be updating this blog everytime I complete reading the book. Books here are divided first by year and then their type/category. Most of the books are accompanied by  related blogs with the extractions from my experience.


_NOTE_: I may read novels from time to time but they won't go in here. The purpose of this blog is to track all non-fictional books I read.
