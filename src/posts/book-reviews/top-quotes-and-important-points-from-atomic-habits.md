Atomic Habit, a book by James Clear is a must read for anyone wanting to change or create a habit. It provides very practical ways to build good habits and break the bad ones.

Together with different strategies and tools to form a new habit, it also contains a range of mind striking quotes and points. Among them, there is one particular that I keep remembering:

> A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.

I doubt I will ever forget this one. Below I have listed some of the quotes and points which I thought were important; chapter by chapter.

### Introduction

- We all deal with setbacks but in the long run,the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.
- With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.
- It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity

- Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

### How to Build Better Habits in Simple Steps

- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.

### The 1st Law: Make it Obvious

- There are no good habits and bad habits. There are only effective habits.
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.

### Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.

### The Secret to Self Control

- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
- People with high self control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it.

### The 2nd Law: Make it Attractive

- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

### The role of family and friends in shaping your habits

- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.
- We tend to adopt habits that are praise and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.
- A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.
- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.

### The 3rd Law: Make it Easy

- Walk slowly, but never backward.
- The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.

### The law of least effort

- Business is a never ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.

### How to stop procrastinating by using the two minute rule

- The two minute rule states, "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do."

### The 4th law: Make it satisfying

- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
- The cardinal rule of behavior change: What is immediately reqarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.
- To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful, even if it's in a small way.
- The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way.
- In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.

### How to stick with good habits everyday

- Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick.
- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit - like marking an X on a calendar.
- Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.
- Don't break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.

### How an accountability partner can change everything

- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.

### The truth about talent (When genes matter and when they don't)

- The secret of maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.
- Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
- Play a game that favors your strengths.
- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.
- Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.

### The Goldilocks rule: How to stay motivated in life and work

- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.
- As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored.
- No habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.
- Stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.
- Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

### The downside of creating good habits

- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

### Little Lessons from the Four Laws

- Happiness is simply the absence of desire.
