Tiny portrait of Myah Graham inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/gAj7DH). Painted with watercolor on hot press paper. 

Final painting measures 2.5&#x2033; x 1.5&#x2033;. Facial features at this size sure are difficult to pull off accurately. I constantly found myself getting the proportions wrong and painting them too large.

**Tools used:**

- [Holbein Artists' Water Color](https://amzn.to/2ZPsCTN)
- Arttec 165 Red Sable Brush, Size 00
