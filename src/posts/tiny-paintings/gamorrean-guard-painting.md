Tiny portrait of a Gamorrean Guard from **Return of the Jedi**. Painted with watercolor on hot press paper.

Final painting measures 1.5&#x2033; x 1.5&#x2033;. Ended up a little more illustrative than realistic, but I'll take it.

**Tools used:**

- [Holbein Artists' Water Color](https://amzn.to/2ZPsCTN)
- Arttec 165 Red Sable Brush, Size 00
