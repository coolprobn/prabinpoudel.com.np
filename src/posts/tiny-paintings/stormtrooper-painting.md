Tiny portrait of a Stormtrooper from **Star Wars**. Painted with watercolor on hot press paper.

Final painting measures 1.5&#x2033; x 1.5&#x2033; and was completed in just under one hour. Underestimated how bad things can go when using white watercolor painting incorrectly. I won't make that mistake again...
