Tiny portrait of Ponda Baba from **Star Wars**. Painted with watercolor on hot press paper.

Final painting measures 1.5&#x2033; x 1.5&#x2033;. Really happy with the colors on this one, even if I lost some of the furry details in the face.

**Tools used:**

- [Holbein Artists' Water Color](https://amzn.to/2ZPsCTN)
- Arttec 165 Red Sable Brush, Size 00
