Tiny self portrait painted with watercolor on hot press paper.

Final painting measures 1.5&#x2033; x 1.5&#x2033; and was completed in just under one hour. I find its always easier to work with foreign media when starting with a familiar subject. In this case it was my own face... well part of it at least.
