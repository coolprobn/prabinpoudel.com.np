PaperFaces portrait of project donator [@bobbydharrell](https://twitter.com/bobbydharrell).

Tried something different this time. Roughed out the face first using a pencil and then started on the background. Usually I approach an illustration the other way around but wanted to nail the face this time.

Rendering the face with shades of gray and dull and dirty reds.
