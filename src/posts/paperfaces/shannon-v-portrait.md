PaperFaces portrait of Shannon V. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/tQUwNH).

Sometimes when I feel lazy I go after a silhouette. Shading goes out the window and the only thing you need to be considered with is drawing an accurate contour. The rest is coloring within the lines...

**Tools used:**

- [Pencil by FiftyThree](https://amzn.to/35tCkJW)
- [Paper for iOS](https://paper.bywetransfer.com/)
