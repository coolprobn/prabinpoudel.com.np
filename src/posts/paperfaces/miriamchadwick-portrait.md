PaperFaces portrait of [@miriamchadwick](http://instagram.com/miriamchadwick).

99.9% of the time I start with the background first.

Build up the figure with pencil first, watercolor second, and back to pencil for refinements.

Using a pencil to add detail gradually. Using a Pogo Connect pen that supports pressure sensitivity makes this much easier.

Rendering hair in Paper can be a lot of fun if you take your time. Start dark and gradually mix white or yellow into the color mixer to make strands that are highlighted.
