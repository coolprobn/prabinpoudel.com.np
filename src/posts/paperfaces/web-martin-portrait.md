PaperFaces portrait of [@web_martin](https://twitter.com/web_martin).

Use soft quick watercolor strokes layered on top of each other to simulate a blurred background. Helps add contrast to the composition when drawing crisp lines in the figures' hair.

Render the face gradually and move fast to soften each stroke. Apply white as needed to lighten darker tones.
