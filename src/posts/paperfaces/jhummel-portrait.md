PaperFaces portrait of [@jhummel](https://twitter.com/jhummel).

Started by filling the background with black and then sketching over it in white. If I made a mistake or didn't like the shape of a line I used black to *erase* it.

If you mix enough white into a color it because opaque and can *erase* the color beneath.
