PaperFaces portrait of project donator [@josearato](https://twitter.com/josearato). Why did I almost draw the entire face this team --- because well, I had to leave something unfinished.

Lightly sketch out the composition to act as a guide for painting with watercolor.

Render the face gradually and move quickly to soften each stroke. Use the pencil to tighten up edges and add shadows in small places.

No need to be precise with lighter base coats in the face. You can always refine later when painting in the clothing.

Short quick pencil marks can make for convincing facial hair. Pinch to zoom in and work dark to light from the edge in.
