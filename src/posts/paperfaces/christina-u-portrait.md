PaperFaces portrait of Christina U. inspired by a photograph on Sktchy.

I'll say this about cloudscapes, they're a million times easier to draw than portraits. I pretty much puked up some color on the canvas in five minutes and smudged it all together in another five and *presto chango*â€¦ one photo-realistic sky for your viewing pleasure.

I can see why they're a popular subject for Paper creators.
