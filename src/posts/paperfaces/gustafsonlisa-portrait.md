PaperFaces portrait of [@Gustafsonlisa](https://twitter.com/Gustafsonlisa). For you Instagram lovers out there I shot a [15 second time lapse](http://instagram.com/p/azMK1xgU09/) using the new video feature added yesterday to the app. I'll probably experiment with it some more and record work in process sketches if I can get the iPad's screen to look less reflective.

**Tools used:**

- [Pogo Connect Bluetooth Smart Pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K448L4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009K448L4&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20)
