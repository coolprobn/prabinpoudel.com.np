Just like [her sister](/paperfaces/everly-autumn-portrait/), *Chlo-worm's* hair can't be tamed.

The more I draw with Paper, the clearer it becomes that I don't have a set process. Sometimes I start with a rough outline that I continuously erase and refine. Other times I jump right to the darks and work backwards towards the light.
