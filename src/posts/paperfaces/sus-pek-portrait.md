PaperFaces portrait of Sus Pek inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/ucx5rc).

I'm a sucker for dramatic lit faces and have more queued up than I have time to draw. This one in particular stuck out to me while listening to **Xasthur** on repeat. The skull like visage and grit found in the original image didn't hurt either...
