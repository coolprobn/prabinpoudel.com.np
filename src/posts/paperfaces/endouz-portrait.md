PaperFaces portrait of [@endouz](https://twitter.com/endouz). Using white to paint lights that could be rain drop refractions... or not.

I start each drawing the same way, backgrounds first y'all.

Outline the face in pencil and then block it out with a variation of white.

You know the drill. Pencil for refinement, watercolor for shading.

Block in clothing with the fountain pen and marker tools and apply any shadows with gradual applications of watercolor.
