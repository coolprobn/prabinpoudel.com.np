PaperFaces portrait of project donator [@xoalexo](https://twitter.com/xoalexo). So glad FiftyThree added a zoom tool because that [iPad zoom trick](http://chris.pirillo.com/unlock-the-ipad-zoom-feature/) just wasn't cutting it.

**Tools used:**

- [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00821TR7G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mademist-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00821TR7G)
- [Paper for iOS](https://paper.bywetransfer.com/)
