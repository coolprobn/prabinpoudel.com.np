PaperFaces portrait of [@Glitchpoke](https://twitter.com/Glitchpoke). Drawing straight lines can be quite difficult on an iPad. The key is to take it slow and constantly refine your edges by coloring over mistakes with neighboring colors. To being this illustration I roughed out all the pixels in pencil and then used a combination of the fountain and ink pens to darken in each of the squares.

**Tools used:**

- [Pogo Connect Bluetooth Smart Pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K448L4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009K448L4&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20)
