PaperFaces portrait of Kapi M. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/udfGaD).

Now that I've removed the sense of urgency I previously felt when working on portraits, I find myself having more time to fill Paper's digital canvas. With this drawing I set my sights on an eye... har har get it?

It's been a while since I drew one and thought it might be fun to challenge myself and see how much detail I could knock out. The contours got away from me in a few places since I still find blending imprecise and over aggressive, but that's to be expected with a tool like Paper.

I'm happy with the finished results, especially when you reduce the size of the drawing --- it looks like a photograph!
