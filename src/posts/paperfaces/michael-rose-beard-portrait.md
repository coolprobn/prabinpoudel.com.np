Thirty-four years and still kicking --- a PaperFaces self portrait on my birthday. Loving the new zoom tool that made added small details to my beard fun and painless. Thanks FiftyThree!

In process sketching. Rough out shapes with watercolor and define them with pencil.

The new zoom tool is a beast and makes adding beard detail fun and easy.
