**Project Donator** [@brianjolive](https://twitter.com/brianjolive) commissioned this portrait of his great friend and long time teacher of **Go**. Below are some in process screen captures over the course of an hour as I worked on the illustration. Let me say this, drawing straight lines on glass and getting the correct perspective isn't easy.

Laying down a base coat of watercolor using pencil to outline the game board and figure.

Building the foreground with layers of watercolor and pencil. I find that using lighter colors painted with 3--4 coats produces better results than one medium to dark coat.

Adding foreground and background elements like the stacks of paper and game pieces. The zoom tool was especially helpful when drawing each piece and allowed for accurate placement on the game board.

Adding highlights and filling in the blue shirt with the pencil --- starting light and darkening with watercolor along the way.
